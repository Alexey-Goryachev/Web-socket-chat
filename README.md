# Web-socket-chat

This is a simple web socket chat. 
To start, run the server_chat.py file in the root of the project and open the html files in the browser (at least twice), then use send each other messages.


Additionally, you can use the "exchange" command in the chat, it will show users the current exchange rate in text format. Or specify the number of days for which you want to see the exchange rate separated by a space (example "exchange 2").


Also added logging to the file when the "exchange" command was executed in the chat
